# jboss-jdbc

Jan 20, 2022

This repo contains JDBC drivers organised as JBoss modules.

The intention is for other JBoss projects to use the gitmodules
mechanism to include this repo as a submodule.

This means that JDBC drivers do not need to be included in every
repo, they can be stored centrally here and then simply referenced.
